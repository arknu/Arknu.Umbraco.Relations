Umbraco Relations Picker
version 2.0
by Asbjørn Riis-Knudsen and patrickdemooij9

This is a relations picker for Umbraco v8. The UI is identical to the Umbraco Content Picker - it just saves as a relation instead.

Once you have installed the package, go to Settings > Data Types and create a new data type to use it. Remember to pick a relation type here.
